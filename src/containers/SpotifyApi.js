// Extend your music app to connect with the Spotify API

// Your app will have at least 2 components
// one that shows off hardcoded information about the band
// one that shows off additional information you think is applicable that can be retrieved from the API
// Use presentational components where appropriate
// Make your data dynamic by using the Spotify API. You will need to register and get an API key to use this API.
// To store your API key(s), make a .env file and make a variable like REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
// You can refer to that key in your code with process.env.REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
// Do not push your .env file to GitHub - add it to your .gitignore file
// Do not deploy this app

process.env.REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
process.env.REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
